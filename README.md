# mirrored-SageMathSims

Software modeling and discrete event simulation is an essential tool for the study and analysis of complex systems. This repository includes ongoing research simulations implemented using the SageMath (http://www.sagemath.org/) mathematics software to validate the application of novel concepts, methods, and techniques coming from encryption-based simulation scenarios.
